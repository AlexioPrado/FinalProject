What struck me as the most difficult to code is the updating fo the array when deleting a task. Not only was this difficult, creating a way to check if the task was important or done was hard to solve. What I believed did great was css, with the limited time i had, and the creation of the html page. Though both can still be imporved on. What was msot difficult in deleting the specified object in the array is to remove it in the first place with using the knowledge of its id and name. I chose to use both so in the case of tasks with the same id, they can be differentiated with the name. Another issue I found was the month function being one month behind. Not much a problem but an unexpected one at that.
